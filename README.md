## 🧭 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
- Integrate with VirusTotal API to pull threat data.
- Schedule periodic API requests to ensure continuous feed updates.
- - Store retrieved data in structured JSON logs (extensible to MongoDB).

### 2️⃣ Data Display
Design UI components to display:
- Threat Levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High)
- IOCs including malicious IPs, URLs, file hashes
- Historical trends and recent alerts

### 3️⃣ User Input & Verification
- Implement forms for users to submit IP addresses or domain names.
- Query APIs to check reputation and threat scores for input indicators.
- Return verification results with threat context.

### 4️⃣ Data Visualization
Plot metrics such as:
- Number of threats detected over time
- Top malicious IPs/domains
- Geographical distribution (optional)

Use libraries like Chart.js for dynamic, responsive charts.

### 5️⃣ Tagging & Export
- Enable tagging threats by category, severity, or source.
- Allow exporting of dashboard data in CSV/JSON/PDF format for reporting.

## 🔍 Usage
- Access the dashboard at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
- View real-time threat feeds on the main page.
- Use the Lookup feature to check any suspicious IP/domain.
- Explore visualizations for threat trends and statistics.
- Tag and export relevant data for reports or compliance.

## 🧪 Sample Scan Targets

You can use the following test IPs/domains to try out the dashboard:

- `8.8.8.8` — Google's Public DNS (safe)
- `testphp.vulnweb.com` — Known for training web attacks (safe)
- `185.199.110.153` — GitHub Pages (safe)
- `s.teamy.cc` — Example flagged domain
- `malicious-site.com` — Example of a suspicious domain
These targets will demonstrate lookup functionality and visualization even with the free VirusTotal API.

---

## 📦 Deliverables
